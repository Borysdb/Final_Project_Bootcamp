Following recent policy changes in Paris, aimed to encourage conversion from cars to alternative forms of transport, I have decided to create an analysis of historic bicycles traffic data between 2018-2021, based on which I will try to predict future use of bicycles in this agglomeration.

Goals:
- Provide insight into bicycles traffic in Paris
- Visualize map of counters / data collection points
- Decide which Paris District has the highest bicycle traffic
- See the influence of Covid-19 pandemy on the bicycle use
- Forecast future traffic
